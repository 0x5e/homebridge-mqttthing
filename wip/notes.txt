Configuration GUI Support
-------------------------

config-ui-x and HOOBS use different configuration schema files to drive their
configuration GUIs. HOOBS plan to add some of the more advanced features from
config-ui-x in the near future, so for now I am focussing on config-ui-x.

The current config.schema.json file from config-ui-x author, @oznu, has two main
limitations:

1. The UI doesn't like properties with multiple types, so can't cope with the
'apply' format of topics (where a { "topic": ..., "apply": ... } object is
provided as an alternative to just the topic string).

        "setBrightness": {
          "topic": "test/lightbulb/setBrightness",
          "apply": "return Math.round( message * 2.55 );"
        },

2. The UI can't handle "startPub" with its user-defined keys.

      "startPub": {
        "test/lightbulb/setOn": "1",
        "test/lightbulb/getOn": "1",
        "test/lightbulb/setBrightness": "200",
        "test/lightbulb/getBrightness": "200",
        "test/lightbulb": "Hello world"
      }


I can't immediately see a solution to issue 1 which wouldn't expose apply()
functions for every topic in the GUI - which I would prefer to avoid as in apply
functions are intended to be an advanced feature for solving specific issues.
Having an 'apply' field below every 'topic' field would be cumbersome. Putting
apply fields in a separate section is possible, but not ideal from a GUI
perspective.

However, I'm considering a new configuration mechanism based on device profiles,
where common devices which currently require apply() functions in order to be
configured would have the 'topics' part of their configuration generated from a
simpler set of configuration properties. This feels like a better solution to
me. For now, custom apply() functions defined directly in the configuration will
require direct editing in JSON.

Issue 2 is easier to solve. I will add an alternative startPub format like:

      "startPub": [
        { "topic": "test/lightbulb/setOn", "message": "1" },
        { "topic": "test/lightbulb/getOn", "message": "1" }
      ]

Some accessories (particularly lightbulb) operate in different 'modes' depending
on the topics configured. There are different types of light (on/off, dimmable,
coloured), and come types of light can operate using different sets of topics
(e.g. separate hue, saturation, brightness, RGB, HSV). Creating simplified
configurations for specific light types could be very helpful here.


So, the plan is:

1. Add alternative startPub format and update config.schema.json to support it. [Done]
2. Review field names and descriptions in config.schema.json. [Done]
3. Release initial config-ui-x support. [Done - Version 1.1.2]
4. Add lightbulb sub-types for easier configuration. [Done]
5. Add configuration profiles.
